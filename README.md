# LeafletGeojsonSaudiFarming

This is my demo app version 24.1.0 (proof-of-concept) based on Leaflet.js library (thanks to the creators https://leafletjs.com/) with GeoJson data to display an interactive map for Saudi Arabia region's farm activities planning. 
All the data is completely "science fiction". Created in October 2024.
