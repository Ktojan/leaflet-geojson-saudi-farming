# LeafletGeojsonSaudiFarming

This is my demo app version 24.2.0 (proof-of-concept) based on Leaflet.js library (thanks to the creators https://leafletjs.com/) and Mapbox API (wrapped in https://github.com/Wykks/ngx-mapbox-gl by Wykks for Angular apps). For Mapbox you'll need your public API token (free for 1 month trial)
AllMost of the data in app is "science fiction". Created in October 2024.
