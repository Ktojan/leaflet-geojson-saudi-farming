# LeafletGeojsonSaudiFarming

This is my demo app version 24.1.0 (proof-of-concept) for the use of Leaflet.js library (thanks to the creators of https://leafletjs.com/) with GeoJson data to display interactive map for Saudi Arabia region's farm activities planning (moisture, NDVI indexes). 
All the data is completely "science fiction". Created in October 2024.

Live demo on Vercel: https://leaflet-geojson-saudi-farming.vercel.app/ 

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
