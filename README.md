# LeafletGeojsonSaudiFarming

This is my demo app (proof-of-concept) for usage of Leaflet.js library (thanks for creators https://leafletjs.com/) with GeoJson data to display interactive map for Saudi Arabia region's farm activities planning (moisture, NDVI indexes). 
All the data is completely "science fiction". Created in October 2024.

## Development server
